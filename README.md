# Covid-19 Data Dashboard
This dashboard was developed using Python v 3.8.2 in VSCode with Flask.

This dataset is composed of a curated collection of over 200 publicly available COVID-19 related datasets from sources like Johns Hopkins, the WHO, the World Bank, the New York Times, and many others. The dashboard focuses specifically on US state infection rates and how they relate to general state health data.
